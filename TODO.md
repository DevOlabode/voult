# voult.dev – Product Roadmap

A centralized authentication-as-a-service platform for developers.

## ✅ MVP – COMPLETE (API-FIRST)

### 🔐 Core Authentication (End Users)
- [x] Register (email + password)
- [x] Login
- [x] Logout (JWT revocation via tokenVersion)
- [x] Get current user (`/me`)
- [x] Email verification flow
- [x] Resend verification email (rate-limited)
- [x] Password reset (forgot + reset)
- [x] Password strength enforcement
- [x] Soft delete / disable account
- [x] Re-enable account
- [x] Prevent login for disabled accounts
- [x] Prevent login for unverified emails

---

### 🧩 App / Client Authentication
- [x] Client ID + Client Secret auth
- [x] Secure client secret hashing
- [x] Client secret rotation
- [x] App enable / disable
- [x] Callback URL allowlist validation
- [x] Per-app usage tracking (logins, registrations)
- [x] App soft delete support

---

### 🛡 Security & Abuse Protection
- [x] Rate limiting (API + auth routes)
- [x] Token expiration handling
- [x] Token revocation on logout / password reset
- [x] Consistent API error format (`ApiError`)
- [x] Centralized API error handler
- [x] Request + auth failure logging

---

### 📄 Developer Experience
- [x] Swagger / OpenAPI documentation
- [x] Postman collection
- [x] Example Node.js SDK
- [x] Example API usage flows
- [x] Clear separation of Web vs API auth logic

---

### 🧠 Architecture Quality
- [x] Modular middleware structure
- [x] CatchAsync error handling
- [x] Joi validation layer
- [x] Clean folder separation (controllers, services, validators)
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Production-ready JWT handling

---
