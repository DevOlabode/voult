# Voult — Authentication as a Service for Developers

Voult.dev is a **developer-first authentication platform** that provides secure, scalable, and easy-to-integrate authentication APIs for modern web applications.

It handles the hard parts of auth — user management, email verification, password resets, JWT handling, and account security — so developers can focus on building products, not auth systems.
